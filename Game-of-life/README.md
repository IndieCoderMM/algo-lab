# ðŸ‘¾ Game Of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton, played on a 2D grid. Player can set up the initial state of grid. When the algorithm starts, every cell on the grid evolves based on the defined rules.

Each cell on the grid can be either _Alive_ or _Dead_ according to the following rules:

### 1. Survival

- Any alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives.

### 2. Underpopulation

- Any alive cell with less than 2 neighbors dies.

### 3. Overpopulation

- Any alive cell with more than 3 neighbors dies.

### 4. Regeneration

- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors comes to life.
